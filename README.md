# 🎛 Physical Interfaces

Right now, I'm working on building a bunch of experimental physical interfaces for web applications.

🕹 [My last experiment](https://github.com/drohen/paddle-game) is an exploration of the Atari paddle controller components to control an electroplankton-inpsired music toy.

∿ Before this, I [built a little oscilloscope](https://github.com/drohen/serial-web-test) to visualise synthesized audio that was being controlled by two potentiometers via Web Serial.

## What's next?

I'm going to be writing about various aspects of building these tools. Firstly, [a boilerplate project](https://github.com/drohen/js-canvas-boilerplate) for quickly whipping up prototypes, and [how to build it yourself](https://javascript.best/posts/how-to-create-and-use-an-html-2d-canvas-boilerplate-project/).

If you're interesting in Web Serial, head over to [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WebSerialAPI/). Additionally, check out [this Awesome List for the Web Serial API](https://github.com/drohen/awesome-web-serial), send a PR if you make something Awesome!

# 🎧 Audio Streaming

 [Rivalium](https://rivalium.com) is a big project for experimental audio streaming, for the browser. It's still in development, and the code is open source.

- [Splutter](https://github.com/drohen/splutter) records, encodes, and uploads audio to a streaming server.
- [Syllid](https://github.com/drohen/syllid) downloads, decodes, and plays audio from a streaming server.
- [Sludge](https://github.com/drohen/sludge) is the streaming server.
- [Sortition](https://github.com/drohen/sortition) is a tool for creating server hubs.

## What's next?

A major update is underway, but there's some challenges. Feel free to get in touch if you're interesting in helping.

# Other stuff

- [Symbiosome](https://github.com/drohen/symbiosome) helps communication between browser apps on different domains (kind of like sockets, I guess).

## What's next?

I have a few projects to upload here, so stay tuned!
