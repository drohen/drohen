# ðŸŽ› Physical Interfaces

I'm working on building interfaces for web applications.

ðŸ•¹ [This experiment](https://github.com/drohen/paddle-game) is an exploration of the Atari paddle controller components to control an electroplankton-inpsired music toy.

âˆ¿ I [built a little oscilloscope](https://github.com/drohen/serial-web-test) to visualise synthesized audio that was being controlled by two potentiometers via Web Serial.

## What's next?

I'm going to be writing about various aspects of building these tools. Firstly, [a boilerplate project](https://github.com/drohen/js-canvas-boilerplate) for quickly whipping up prototypes, and [how to build it yourself](https://javascript.best/posts/how-to-create-and-use-an-html-2d-canvas-boilerplate-project/).

If you're interesting in Web Serial, head over to [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WebSerialAPI/). Additionally, check out [this Awesome List for the Web Serial API](https://github.com/drohen/awesome-web-serial), send a PR if you make something Awesome!

# Other stuff

- [Symbiosome](https://github.com/drohen/symbiosome) helps communication between browser apps on different domains (kind of like sockets, I guess).

## What's next?

I have a few projects to upload here, so stay tuned!
